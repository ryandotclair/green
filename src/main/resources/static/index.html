        You did it! You've just experienced a <span class="highlight blue">blue</span> / <span class="highlight green">green</span> deployment that comes out of the box with Azure Spring Apps Enterprise!
        <br>
        <br>
        Pretty cool, right? Well, Riddler found out and he's upset you've exposed his secret to the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        When you promote staging to production with Azure Spring Apps Enterprise, production becomes staging. Which means Riddler can very easily <span class="highlight black">rollback</span> this change.
        <br>
        <br>
        Tell Riddler, exactly, this: <span class="highlight small"> I promise I won't tell anyone the secret you've been hiding is Leaf Green (#5ca904) is the official color of Spring.io </span> and he will give you your next clue.
        <br>
        <br>
        Oh, and when you visit this page again, it will be reverted to what it was.
        <br>
        <br>
        And remember, you're promising not to tell anyone his secret.
